# Lunar Lander with Fuel Resource Management
**Deep Q-Network (DQN) controlling a lunar lander that must land safely while conserving fuel**

Classic Lunar Lander is too easy when fuel is unlimited.  
This project makes it realistic: **fuel is limited**, added directly into the observation space, and the reward function heavily punishes wasting it.



### What's Different & Cool
- Custom `FuelWrapper` → turns standard 8D state into **9D** (adds remaining fuel)
- Dense + shaped rewards:
  → distance penalty, velocity penalty, angle penalty  
  → **+0.1 bonus every step** if fuel > 20%  
  → **-100 instant death** if fuel runs out mid-air
- Baseline: Vanilla DQN with experience replay
- Ready for Double DQN / Dueling DQN / Prioritized Replay in the future

### Environment Note
- Using `LunarLander-v3` (v2 is deprecated as of 2025, v3 is 100% identical in physics, state, and actions)
- Observation: `Box(-inf, inf, (9,), float32)` → 8 physics vars + fuel
- Action: `Discrete(4)` → nothing / left / main / right engine

### Quick Demo
```bash
# Install
pip install "gymnasium[box2d]" torch matplotlib numpy

# Verify the 9D environment works
python test_env.py
